What’s the output operating metric or financial metric that’s most important to move?\n* Rides per day/week/month: ride volume would directly impact Uber's revenue. \n* Average revenue per ride: moniter the revenue statistics can help determine effective promotion and fee structure.\n* Market share: higher market share and penetration would indicate a larger user base and potential for revenue growth.\n\n2. What’s the input metric that is the most powerful one to move, to move that output metric? \n* User engagement: monitor user's level with promotions or discounts could provide insights to operation strategy.\n* Rating system: collect feedback from users can help optimize user experience.\n* User pattern: understand user's preference and needs from their pattens could provide insights to attract or retain users.\n\n3. What are the best 2-3 ideas of initiatives to move that input metric? \n* Suburban Promotions\n* Weekend Getaways\n* Revitalize Uber Carpooling Service\n\nWe will demonstrate the output and input metrics through data visualization, with a particular focus on the third initiative, 'Revitalize Uber Carpooling Service,' in the conclusion part of our analysis.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis analysis utilizes data on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014. The data is organized into six files, separated by month, and includes the following columns:\n\n- Date/Time: The date and time of the Uber pickup\n- Lat: The latitude of the Uber pickup\n- Lon: The longitude of the Uber pickup\n- Base: The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup\n\nAs we do not have access to revenue or fee per trip information, our analysis will focus on analyzing user patterns in date and time to gain insights.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import packages:\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport

This suggests that there may be increased demand for Uber rides on Thursdays and Fridays, possibly due to higher travel activity, events, or other factors during these weekdays. \n\n* **All 33 pit days, or days with the lowest ride counts, were observed on Sundays,** indicating relatively lower demand for Uber rides on Sundays during this period.\n\n\nThese observations from the half-year data align with our findings from April 2014, indicating that the observed patterns are not seasonal but rather continuous. \n\nThis also supports our proposal that higher commute needs during weekdays result in increased ride volume, while reduced activities on weekends lead to decreased ride demands.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Heatmap Analysis of Uber Ride Patterns in NYC: Validating Proposals:\n\nTo further validate our proposal regarding weekday commute needs and reduced ride demands on weekends -- \n\nWe will create heatmaps using the 'Lat' and 'Lon' columns from the original data to visualize ride patterns on Thursday (peak day) and Sunday (off-peak day). \n\nWe will name these heatmaps Thursday_heatmap and Sunday_heatmap, respectively, and by comparing them, we can gain valuable insights.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Thursday Rides Heatmap:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Parse data:\nthursday_data= data_apr[data_apr['Day_of_Week']=='aThursday']\n\nimport folium\nfrom folium.plugins import HeatMap\nheatmap_thursday= folium.Map(location= [40.7128,-74.0060], zoom_start= 12)\n\n# Add heapmap layer to the NYC map:\nHeatMap(thursday_data[['Lat','Lon']].values).add_to(heatmap_thursday)\n\nheatmap_thursday","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-13T19:13:24.506793Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-13T19:13:24.507204Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-13T19:13:25.541032Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-13T19:13:24.507169Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-13T19:13:25.539535Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Sunday Rides Heatmap:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Parse data:\nsunday_data= data_apr[data_apr['Day_of_Week']=='aSunday']\n\nimport folium\nfrom folium.plugins import HeatMap\nheatmap_sunday= folium.Map(location= [40.7128,-74.0060], zoom_start= 12)\n\n# Add heapmap layer to the NYC map:\nHeatMap(sunday_data[['Lat','Lon']].values).add_to(heatmap_sunday)\n\nheatmap_sunday","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-13T19:11:46.372765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-13T19:11:46.373273Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-13T19:11:46.999895Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-13T19:11:46.373233Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-13T19:11:46.998336Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Observation 3 -- from Heatmap:\n\nOur observation of Uber ride patterns in NYC reveals that Thursdays consistently show the highest ride volume throughout the year --\n\nThe Thursday heatmap indicating a wider range of rides extending to suburban areas such as Bridgeport, Clverton, and Bridgewater Township. \n\nIn contrast, on Sundays, the rides are concentrated in areas like New Brunswick and downtown. \n\nThese two heatmaps provide compelling evidence to support our proposal that weekday commute needs are the **primary drivers** of ride demand, while reduced activity on weekends represents a **key pain point**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initiatives for Revenue Boosting:\n\nBased on this observation, UBER could consider the following initiatives to potentially boost revenue:\n\n**1. Suburban Promotions:** UBER could run targeted promotions or marketing campaigns to attract more riders from suburban areas on Thursdays, such as offering discounted fares or incentives for rides originating from those areas. This could help increase the number of rides during the weekdays and generate additional revenue.\n\n**2. Revitalize Uber Carpooling Service:** Uber launched its carpooling service two years ago, but it has struggled to gain traction among users, earning it the moniker of a 'zombie' service. Many people find it less appealing than traditional Uber rides due to the perception of spending more time on the road. However, with some strategic improvements, Uber could turn its carpooling service into a successful revenue driver.\n\nOverall, analyzing the observed patterns in the UBER heatmap and tailoring promotions, marketing, and supply optimization strategies based on the demand patterns could potentially help UBER boost their revenue in NYC and better serve their riders' needs.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initiatives 1 -- Suburban Promotions: \n\nIt's important to establish clear and **measurable success criteria** for promotion plan to track its effectiveness and make data-driven decisions for future marketing efforts. \n\nFor example, success criteria could include:\n\n**1. Increased Ride Volume:** \n\nOne of the main objectives of the promotion plan could be to increase the number of rides taken by riders from suburban areas on Thursdays. \n\nThe success criteria for this could be 20% percentage increase in the total number of rides compared to the previous Thursdays or a target number of additional rides from suburban areas on Thursdays.\n\n**2. Expanded Geographical Reach:** \n\nAnother success criteria could be to expand the geographical reach of Uber rides in suburban areas on Thursdays. \n\nThis could be measured by the number of new suburban areas where Uber rides are taken on Thursdays, or the increase in the total number of rides in previously under-served suburban areas.\n\n\nUber is known to regularly launch promotions, discounts, and marketing campaigns to attract and retain riders, and these promotions can vary in terms of their scope, duration, and success. The effectiveness of promotions can depend on various factors, here are some **possible reasons that our SubUrban Promotion may not work**:\n\n**1. Lack of Awareness:** \n\nIf the promotion plan is not effectively communicated to potential riders in suburban areas, they may not be aware of the incentives or marketing campaigns being offered. \n\nThis could result in a lack of response or participation in the promotion.\n\n**2. Operational Limitations:** \n\nOperational limitations such as limited availability of Uber drivers in suburban areas on Thursdays, longer wait times, or insufficient coverage in certain areas may hinder the success of the promotion. \n\nIf customers find it difficult to take Uber rides due to operational constraints, it may negatively impact the effectiveness of the promotion.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initiatives 2 -- Revitalize Carpooling Service: \n\nBy implementing appointment-based system, optimizing nearby customer matching, and investing in promotions and advertising, Uber can revitalize carpooling service and turn it into a successful revenue driver. \n\nWith **strategic improvements**, Uber can attract more users to its carpooling service and position it as a convenient, efficient, and cost-effective option for daily commuting and leisure trips.\n\n\n**1. Appointment-based system:** \n\nUber could implement an appointment-based system for carpooling, where users can schedule their rides in advance. \n\nThis would allow users to plan their commute from suburban areas to their workplace during weekdays and from leisure concentrated areas to suburban areas during weekends. \n\nUsers could make carpool appointments up to 12 hours before departure, similar to the successful example of **DIDI's carpooling service** in China, where 60% of users make appointments for their commute. \n\nThis would provide convenience and predictability to users, saving them time on waiting and matching for rides.\n\n**2. Nearby customer matching with route tracking:**\n\nUber can leverage its data and algorithms to efficiently match nearby customers with drivers for carpooling. \n\nBy optimizing the matching process, Uber can reduce detours and waiting time, making the carpooling service more efficient and attractive to users. \n\nAdditionally, Uber can work together with map technology companies, such as Google Maps, to track people's commute routes. \n\nIf Uber identifies users who repeat the same route on weekdays, and finds other users who have similar repetitive routes, it can recommend selected users to join the Uber carpooling service. \n\nThis would not only help to find potential users but also increase the number of users per ride, resulting in higher revenue for Uber.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Same as the first initiative, we could set **success criteria** for the carpooling service initiative. \n\nGiven that it's a relative new service, we want to set the criteria in three phases:\n\n**Phase 1: Advertising and Promotion**\n\nSuccess Criteria: Increase in new users of carpooling service by a certain percentage within a specified timeframe.\n\nExample: Achieve a 20% increase in new users of carpooling service within the first 3 months of the initiative.\n\n**Phase 2: Customer Retention and Rating**\n\nSuccess Criteria: Improvement in customer retention rate and positive customer ratings for carpooling service.\n\nExample: Increase customer retention rate by 10% and maintain an average customer rating of 4 stars or higher on a scale of 5 stars, within the first 6 months of the initiative.\n\n**Phase 3: Market Share**\n\nSuccess Criteria: Attain a certain percentage of market share in commute rides for carpooling service.\n\nExample: Capture 40% market share of all commute rides in the target market within 12 months of the initiative.\n\nThese success criteria can be measured using relevant metrics such as new user sign-ups, retention rate, customer ratings, and market share data. \n\nRegular monitoring and evaluation of these criteria can help assess the progress and effectiveness of your carpooling service initiative and make data-driven decisions for further improvements.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What's more?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through our analysis! We have delved into a vast dataset, examined the data, created visualizations, and uncovered interesting patterns.\n\nBased on my previous work experience, my next step would be to engineer additional features such as customer demographics, fees per ride, and feedback, and incorporate them into machine learning models to predict Uber's future revenue.\n\nHowever, due to the limitations of variables in the current dataset, such as the absence of transaction data and user demographics, it may not be meaningful to develop predictive models at this stage.\n\nThe good news is that I have identified a UBER user dataset available on AWS, albeit with a subscription cost of $1,500 USD.\n\nAs we conclude this analysis, I hope you found it informative and enjoyable. \n\nIf you have any suggestions or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact me via melodyheee@outlook.com.
